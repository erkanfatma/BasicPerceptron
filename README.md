## Neural Network

There are many kinds of models for machine learning. Neural Network is one of them. It draws inspiration from the human brain and its biological neural networks. Neural network imitates the learning, memorizing, and generalizing ability of brain. The learning operation of a neural network occurs using training data. There are some basic points of it such as input values, output values and rules. The mathematical model of neural system of the human brains represented in the following figure.
